## Maverick

You will be wondering what inspired this website, well it was a combination of things. At first I was thinking of something similar to paper like the one I always have with me (my journal lol). I was researching themes and colors with fonts to match my taste. I am someone that have a variable test so i ended up using a green color as my primary color and an off white bg. I have red and yellow that varies based on which bg i go with. It still gives the paper aesthetic but kinda with my twist. I designed everything on figma and adobe illustrator. I did my logo from not scratch just improved the one I got from a friend. But the color and typography were built from scratch. at the end of my website I will tell why I make these choices. Implementing the code was a very big challenge for me even with the help of figma to code. my big mistake was debug the shits it gave me which wasted my time without any meaningful progress. I have to restart from scratch.
